All principles of gravity are negated by fear.\n\tPsychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel\n\tthem directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky noise or an\n\tadversary's signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to\n\tthe cradle of a chandelier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole.\n\tThe feet of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding\n\tauto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight.\nVI.

But\nothers would not.  And still others, such as the Spectacularly Rev.\nJerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing the wildebeest naked.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"Pornography\"\n",

    "The Worst Musical Trio\n\tThere are few bad musicians who have a chance to give a recital at\na famous concert hall while still learning the rudiments of their\ninstrument.  This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian\ngentleman who was owed a personal favour by Georges Enesco, the celebrated\nviolinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\nunhampered by great musical talent.\n\tThree years later the boy's father insisted that he give a public\nconcert.  \"His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\nA cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.\"  Although\nEnesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\nin Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n\t\"Then you must accompany him on the piano,\" said the boy's father,\n\"and it will be a sell out.\"\n\tReluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited\naudience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and\nasked for someone to turn his pages.\n\tIn the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who\nvolunteered and made his way to the stage.\n\tThe soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the\nmusic critic of Le Figaro wrote: \"There was a strange concert at the Salle\nGaveau last night.  The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played\nthe piano.  Another whom we adore when he plays the piano turned the pages.\nBut the man who should have turned the pages played the violin.\"\n\t\t-- Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\"\n",

What's going on?\"\n\t\"It's me -- Bob,\" replies a faraway voice.\n\tExcitedly he sits up in bed.  \"Bob!  Bob!  Is that you?

It involves a sense of future, a belief\nthat every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.\nThe trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It's hard to\nrecognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to\nlearn that we don't leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the\ndugout or the office. We own what we learned back there.  The experiences\nand the growth are grafted onto our lives.  And when we exit, we can take\nourselves along -- quite gracefully.\n\t\t-- Ellen Goodman\n",

    "Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):\n\nHorses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs, and in\nfront they have fore-legs.  This makes six legs, which is certainly an\nodd number of legs for a horse.  But the only number that is both even\nand odd is infinity.  Therefore, horses have an infinite number of\nlegs.  Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,\nthere is a horse that has a finite number of legs.  But that is a horse\nof another color, and by the lemma [\"All horses are the same color\"],\nthat does not exist.\n",

Pull one of these\n\thorses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n\tof these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n\ttook out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n\thorses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n\tare all the same color.

It\n\tis also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in\n\tback.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a\n\thorse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is\n\tinfinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.\n\tHowever, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an\n\tinfinite number of legs.

If any word is improper at the end of\na sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing\nmetaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should be\ncareful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.\nAlways pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.

    "Some of the most interesting documents from Sweden's middle ages are the\nold county laws (well, we never had counties but it's the nearest equivalent\nI can find for \"landskap\").

The oldest one is\nthe Vastgota law which clearly has pagan influences, thinly covered with some\nChristian stuff.  In this law, we find a page about \"lekare\", which is the\nOld Norse word for a performing artist, actor/jester/musician etc.  Here is\nan approximate translation, where I have written \"artist\" as equivalent of\n\"lekare\".\n\t\"If an artist is beaten, none shall pay fines for it.  If an artist\n\tis wounded, one such who goes with hurdie-gurdie or travels with\n\tfiddle or drum, then the people shall take a wild heifer and bring\n\tit out on the hillside.  Then they shall shave off all hair from the\n\theifer's tail, and grease the tail.  Then the artist shall be given\n\tnewly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of the heifer's tail,\n\tand a man shall strike it with a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he\n\tshall have the animal.

    "The justifications for drug testing are part of the presently fashionable\ndebate concerning restoring America's \"competitiveness.\" Drugs, it has been\nrevealed, are responsible for rampant absenteeism, reduced output, and poor\nquality work.  But is drug testing in fact rationally related to the\nresurrection of competitiveness?  Will charging the atmosphere of the\nworkplace with the fear of excretory betrayal honestly spur productivity?\nMuch noise has been made about rehabilitating the worker using drugs, but\nto date the vast majority of programs end with the simple firing or the not\nhiring of the abuser.  This practice may exacerbate, not alleviate, the\nnation's productivity problem.

There, that's it: 24 words.  But the guy who wrote the book took\n*thousands* of words to say it.\n\tOr consider \"The Brothers Karamazov\", by the famous Russian alcoholic\nFyodor Dostoyevsky.  It's about these two brothers who kill their father.\nOr maybe only one of them kills the father.  It's impossible to tell because\nwhat they mostly do is talk for nearly a thousand pages.  If all Russians talk\nas much as the Karamazovs did, I don't see how they found time to become a\nmajor world power.\n\tI'm told that Dostoyevsky wrote \"The Brothers Karamazov\" to raise\nthe question of whether there is a God.  So why didn't he just come right\nout and say: \"Is there a God?

Yes, here we are!\nLook at that, isn't it neat?  Now that is a FrintArms product as well,\nbut it's what's called a laser -- a light-pistol some people call\nthem.

Here, feel that -- don't\nworry, it's a dummy battery -- isn't it neat?  Feel how light it is?\nSmooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*\nbeautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there's\nno recoil.  Because it's shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,\nbeautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That's not a line, she\nreally has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a free\ncharge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a special\noffer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, for\none-forty-nine.\"\n\n\"I'll take the special.\"\n\n\"Sound choice, madam, *sound* choice.  Now, do--?\"\n\n\"And a HandCannon, with the eighty-mill silencer, five GP clips, three\nsix-five AP/wire-fl'\bechettes clips, two bipropellant HE clips, and a\nSpecial Projectile Pack if you have one -- the one with the embedding\nrounds, not the signalers.

    "The Poet Whose Badness Saved His Life\n\tThe most important poet in the seventeenth century was George\nWither.  Alexander Pope called him \"wretched Wither\" and Dryden said of his\nverse that \"if they rhymed and rattled all was well\".\n\tIn our own time, \"The Dictionary of National Biography\" notes that his\nwork \"is mainly remarkable for its mass, fluidity and flatness.  It usually\nlacks any genuine literary quality and often sinks into imbecile doggerel\".\n\tHigh praise, indeed, and it may tempt you to savour a typically\nrewarding stanza: It is taken from \"I loved a lass\" and is concerned with\nthe higher emotions.\n\t\tShe would me \"Honey\" call,\n\t\tShe'd -- O she'd kiss me too.\n\t\tBut now alas!  She's left me\n\t\tFalero, lero, loo.\n\tAmong other details of his mistress which he chose to immortalize\nwas her prudent choice of footwear.\n\t\tThe fives did fit her shoe.\n\tIn 1639 the great poet's life was endangered after his capture by\nthe Royalists during the English Civil War.  When Sir John Denham, the\nRoyalist poet, heard of Wither's imminent execution, he went to the King and\nbegged that his life be spared.  When asked his reason, Sir John replied,\n\"Because that so long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the\nworst poet in England.\"\n\t\t-- Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\"\n",

    "The Worst American Poet\n\tJulia Moore, \"the Sweet Singer of Michigan\" (1847-1920) was so bad that\nMark Twain said her first book gave him joy for 20 years.\n\tHer verse was mainly concerned with violent death -- the great fire\nof Chicago and the yellow fever epidemic proved natural subjects for her pen.\n\tWhether death was by drowning, by fits or by runaway sleigh, the\nformula was the same:\n\t\tHave you heard of the dreadful fate\n\t\tOf Mr. P.P.

A critic of the day said she was \"worse than\na Gatling gun\" and in one slim volume counted 21 killed and 9 wounded.\n\tIncredibly, some newspapers were critical of her work, even\nsuggesting that the sweet singer was \"semi-literate\".  Her reply was\nforthright: \"The Editors that has spoken in this scandalous manner have went\nbeyond reason.\"  She added that \"literary work is very difficult to do\".\n\t\t-- Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\"\n",

He asserted that they could prepare\nthe specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be \nwell-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futhermore, if\nthe architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs\nfor ten months.\n\nTo this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program\nteam the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would\nalso be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He\nwas right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made\nthe system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it\nadded a year to debugging time.\n- Frederick Brooks Jr., \"The Mythical Man Month\" \n",

    "I have sacrificed time, health, and fortune, in the desire to complete these\nCalculating Engines.  I have also declined several offers of great personal\nadvantage to myself.  But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages\nfor the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and after\nexpending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government of\nEngland has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only commenced,\nI have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even the offer\nof those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the reach of men\nwho devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...  \n\nIf the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were a mere\ntriumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the execution\nof such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some justification\nmight be found for the course which has been taken; but I venture to assert\nthat no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will ever publicly express\nan opinion that such a machine would be useless if made, and that no man\ndistinguished as a civil engineer will venture to declare the construction of\nsuch machinery impracticable...\n\nAnd at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed by that\nexhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its advancement,\nwhich it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I think the \napplication of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse\ncalculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.\nIn fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not\nbe economized by the aid of machinery.\n- Charles Babbage, Passage from the Life of a Philosopher\n",

Something happens between first and twelfth grade,\nand it's not just puberty.

Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of\nknowledge a serpent -- slimy, sneaking and abominable.  Since the earliest\ndays the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every\neffort to liberate the body and mind of man.  It has been, at all times and\neverywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad\nlaws, bad social theories, bad institutions.

The \nproblem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to\na religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy\nis generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and \nirrational -- the powers of reason are suprisingly ineffective in \nchanging the believer's mind.\n- Steve Allen, comdeian, from an essay in the book \"The Courage of \n  Conviction\", edited by Philip Berman\n",

    "We may not be able to persuade Hindus that Jesus and not Vishnu should\ngovern their spiritual horizon, nor Moslems that Lord Buddha is at the\ncenter of their spiritual universe, nor Hebrews that Mohammed is a major\nprohpet, nor Christians that Shinto best expresses their spiritual \nconcerns, to say nothing of the fact that we may not be able to get\nChristians to agree among themselves about their relationship to God.\nBut all will agree on a proposition that they possess profound spiritual\nresources.  If, in addition, we can get them to accept the further\nproposition that whatever form the Deity may have in their own theology,\nthe Deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and\nthey themselves give proof or disproof of the Deity in what they do and\nthink; if this further proposition can be accepted, then we come that\nmuch closer to a truly religious situation on earth.\n- Norman Cousins, from his book \"Human Options\"\n",

    "If one inquires why the American tradition is so strong against any\nconnection of State and Church, why it dreads even the rudiments of\nreligious teaching in state-maintained schools, the immediate and\nsuperficial answer is not far to seek....\nThe cause lay largely in the diversity and vitality of the various\ndenominations, each fairly sure that, with a fair field and no favor,\nit could make its own way; and each animated by a jealous fear that,\nif any connection of State and Church were permitted, some rival\ndenomination would get an unfair advantage.\n- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher, \n  from \"Democracy in the Schools\", 1908\n",
    "Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that\nevery subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be\nsubmitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered \nsamples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to \ncommon tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that\nany such \"show-down\" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic\nof religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually\nsecret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generall known; \nauthoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary \nways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is\nconceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,\nthere is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in\nreligion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics\nwhere the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The \"religious\"\nwould be the last to be willing that either the history of the\ncontent of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those\nto whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,\nbut is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against\nits being taught in any other spirit.\n- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher, \n  from \"Democracy in the Schools\", 1908\n",
    "In the broad and final sense all institutions are educational in the\nsense that they operate to form the attitudes, dispositions, abilities\nand disabilities that constitute a concrete personality...Whether this\neducative process is carried on in a predominantly democratic or non-\ndemocratic way becomes, therefore, a question of transcendent importance\nnot only for education itself but for its final effect upon all the\ninterests and activites of a society that is committed to the democratic\nway of life.\n- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher\n",
    "History shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge,\nperiodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts\nthem asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing\ngrub, at intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another...\nTruly the imago state of Man seems to be terribly distant, but every\nmoult is a step gained.\n- Charles Darwin, from \"Origin of the Species\"\n",

On the corners stand witchdoctors and\nheadhunters, babbling voodoo-men -- the natives, the jungle-smart natives.\nAnd at night, under the equatorial overgrowth and heat-holding cloud\ncover, you hear the ragged parrot-hoot and monkeysqueak of the sirens,\nand then fires flower to ward off monsters.

We're dealing with\nbeliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There's nothing there....\nIt sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technical\nterms.  It's got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite\nglib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from\nmetaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The\nfact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that\nshould be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They\nhave not proved their case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there's\nno theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It's been tested\nand tested over the centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at\nall.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it\nhas to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --\nyou test it.

    "Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about\nastrology] aside for a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.\nWhy would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an\neffect on our characters, lives, or destinies?  What force or influence,\nwhat sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human\nbeings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding\njargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central\nproblem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which\ncelestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .\nSome astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents\nthe astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those\nof any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always\nclaim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their\nefficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have\ngenerously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed\ntests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .\nI propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest\nin the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them\nkeep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by\nthe firelight, afraid of the night.\n-- Andrew Fraknoi, Executive Officer, Astronomical Society of the Pacific,\n    \"Why Astrology Believers Should Feel Embarrassed,\" San Jose Mercury\n    News, May 8, 1988\n",

Sadly, such\nhappenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestations\nof a well-established \"anti-science\" tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,\ncould threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  The\nmanifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series\nof quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur\nwell for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its\nindustrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a \nsignificant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance\nof and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching\ntruth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself up\nsoon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope of\nmaintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,\nwith a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not\nsuffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.\n-- Physicist Tony Feinberg, in \"New Scientist,\" May 19, 1988\n",

The moment one gets into the\n\"expert\" state of mind a great number of things become impossible.\"\n-- From Henry Ford Sr., \"My Life and Work,\" p. 86 (1922):\n",

Well we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 31.\nWe were 15 days on the water, and 3 on the boat when we finally arrived in\nAfrica.  Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at\n6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by\n6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That\nwas the biggest game we had.  Africa is primerally inhabited by Elks, Moose\nand Knights of Pithiests.\n\tThe elks live up in the mountains and come down once a year for their\nannual conventions.  And you should see them gathered around the water hole,\nwhich they leave immediately when they discover it's full of water.  They\nweren't looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.\n\tOne morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my\npajamas, I don't know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That's a tough\nword to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were\nimbedded so firmly we couldn't get them out.

The starter motor\nrequires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that's why the wire\ngoing to it is so large.\n\tFeeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.

At Harvard\none August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the\n\"granddaddy\" of modern computers, the Mark I.  \"Things were going badly;\nthere was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed\ncomputer,\" she said.  \"Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using\nordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when\nanything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it.\"  Hopper\nsaid that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, \"I referred\nthem to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons\nCenter, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in\nquestion.\"\n\t\t[actually, the term \"bug\" had even earlier usage in\n\t\tregard to problems with radio hardware.

The following story is told about him: when they\nmoved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely\nuseless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He\nreached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\nsome notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\nthrew the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\nhe had moved to, saying, \"Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I'm Norbert Weiner\nand we've just moved.  Would you know where we've moved to?\"  To which the\nyoung girl replied, \"Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.\"\n\tThe capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.  She said that it wasn't\nquite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!  The rest of it,\nhowever, was pretty close to what actually happened...\n\t\t-- Richard Harter\n",

It's great for students, great for somewhat casual\nusers, and it's great for interchanging programs between different machines.\nAnd so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have\ngood UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.\n\tIt is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run\nout of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will end\nup doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.\n\tWith UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly\ncheck that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no matter\nwhat you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if\nyou look long enough it's there.

The problem\nof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\nof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\nbian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\npond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\nthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\nto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\nfunctions.\n\tThis is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\nThis is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\n\tRefreshments will be served.

    "***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)\n\nIt has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge \nin order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, \nwe have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call \n\"wisdom engineering\".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a \nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.  \nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom \nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so \nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic \nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL \nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed \nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those \nunderlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory\nof value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe \nIMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly \ndiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.\n",

    "\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10: SIMPLE\n\nSIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming Language\nEnvironment.  This language, developed at the Hanover College for\nTechnological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code\nwith errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,\nEND and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't make\na syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.  Thus\nthey achieve the results of programs written in other languages without\nthe tedious, frustrating process of testing and debugging.\n",

The warlord asked the programmer: \"Which is easier to design:\nan accounting package or an operating system?\"\n\t\"An operating system,\" replied the programmer.\n\tThe warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  \"Surely an\naccounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating\nsystem,\" he said.\n\t\"Not so,\" said the programmer, \"when designing an accounting package,\nthe programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:\nhow it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to\nthe tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside\nappearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the\nsimplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system\nis easier to design.\"\n\tThe warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  \"That is all good and well, but\nwhich is easier to debug?\"\n\tThe programmer made no reply.\n\t\t-- Geoffrey James, \"The Tao of Programming\"\n",
    "\tThere was once a programmer who worked upon microprocessors.  \"Look at\nhow well off I am here,\" he said to a mainframe programmer who came to visit,\n\"I have my own operating system and file storage device.

Why do you not quit your present job and join me here?\"\n\tThe mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his\nfriend, saying: \"The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in the\nmidst of the data center.  Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great ocean\nof machinery.  The software is a multi-faceted as a diamond and as convoluted\nas a primeval jungle.  The programs, each unique, move through the system\nlike a swift-flowing river.  That is why I am happy where I am.\"\n\tThe microcomputer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent.

    "A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feminist\nthought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed the\nproblem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male\naggression.  Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shy\naway from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman's\nparticipation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibility\nwill appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women to\nmen.  More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: to\nidealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched by\nthe system of domination, as if people did not participate in their own\nsubmission.  To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-to\nis to substitute moral outrage for analysis.\n\t\t-- Jessica Benjamin, \"The Bonds of Love\"\n",

A man will start by\ngrabbing the cherry in the center.\n\nCar repair:\n\tThe average man thinks his Y chromosome contains complete repair\nmanuals for every car made since World War II.  He will work on a problem\nhimself until it either goes away or turns into something that \"can't be\nfixed without special tools\".\n\tThe average woman thinks \"that funny thump-thump noise\" is an\naccurate description of an automotive problem.

A man will let new shirts sit on\nthe shelf in their original packaging for a couple of years before putting\nthem to use, hoping they'll become more comfortable with age.\n\tWomen think clothes are radioactive, with a half-life of one year.\nThey exercise precautions to avoid contamination by last year's fashions.\n",

This same woman wouldn't tell her best friend if\nshe knew the best friends' mate was having an affair.  She'll tell all her\nOTHER friends, however.  The average man won't say anything if he knows that\none of his friend's mates is fooling around, and he'd rather not know if\nhis mate is having an affair either, out of fear that it might be with one\nof his friends.  He will tell all his friends about his own affairs, though,\nso they can be ready if he needs an alibi.\n\nDriving:\n\tA typical man thinks he's Mario Andretti as soon as he slips behind\nthe wheel of his car.

    "\t\t\t-- Gifts for Men --\n\nMen are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional ice\nhockey is so popular -- so buying gifts for them is easy.  But you should\nnever buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the clothes they\nwill ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For example, your average\nman has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only three of them.  He has learned,\nthrough humiliating trial and error, that if he wears any of the other 81\nties, his wife will probably laugh at him (\"You're not going to wear THAT\ntie with that suit, are you?\"). So he has narrowed it down to three safe\nties, and has gone several years without being laughed at.  If you give him\na new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.\n\nIf you want to give a man something practical, consider tires.

Symptoms resemble very\nmuch those of cyanide poisoning (blue face, etc.).  In higher\nconcentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it\ntakes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.  The reason\nfor the delay is the difference in the mechanism of the toxic effect of\noxygen in 20% concentration.  It apparently contributes to a complex\nprocess called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is\nalways fatal.\n\nHowever, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the\nfact it is habit forming.

    "A Thaum is the basic unit of magical strength.  It has been universally\nestablished as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon\nor three normal sized billiard balls.\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Light Fantastic\"\n",
    "\"A wizard cannot do everything; a fact most magicians are reticent to admit,\nlet alone discuss with prospective clients.  Still, the fact remains that \nthere are certain objects, and people, that are, for one reason or another, \ncompletely immune to any direct magical spell.  It is for this group of\nbeings that the magician learns the subtleties of using indirect spells.\nIt also does no harm, in dealing with these matters, to carry a large club\nnear your person at all times.\"\n\t\t-- The Teachings of Ebenezum, Volume VIII\n",
    "An ancient proverb summed it up: when a wizard is tired of looking for\nbroken glass in his dinner, it ran, he is tired of life.\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Light Fantastic\"\n",
    "Chaos is King and Magic is loose in the world.\n",
    "Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they become soggy and hard to\nlight.\n",

    "Eight was also the Number of Bel-Shamharoth, which was why a sensible wizard\nwould never mention the number if he could avoid it.  Or you'll be eight\nalive, apprentices were jocularly warned.  Bel-Shamharoth was especially\nattracted to dabblers in magic who, by being as it were beachcombers on the\nshores of the unnatural, were already half-enmeshed in his nets.\nRincewind's room number in his hall of residence had been 7a.  He hadn't\nbeen surprised.\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Sending of Eight\"\n",
    "\"How do you know she is a unicorn?\" Molly demanded.  \"And why were you afraid\nto let her touch you?  I saw you.  You were afraid of her.\"\n\t\"I doubt that I will feel like talking for very long,\" the cat\nreplied without rancor.  \"I would not waste time in foolishness if I were \nyou.  As to your first question, no cat out of its first fur can ever be\ndeceived by appearances.  Unlike human beings, who enjoy them.  As for your\nsecond question --\"  Here he faltered, and suddenly became very interested\nin washing; nor would he speak until he had licked himself fluffy and then\nlicked himself smooth again.  Even then he would not look at Molly, but \nexamined his claws.\n\t\"If she had touched me,\" he said very softly, \"I would have been\nhers and not my own, not ever again.\"\n\t\t-- Peter S. Beagle, \"The Last Unicorn\"\n",
    "It is a well known fact that warriors and wizards do not get along, because\none side considers the other side to be a collection of bloodthirsty idiots\nwho can't walk and think at the same time, while the other side is naturally\nsuspicious of a body of men who mumble a lot and wear long dresses.  Oh, say\nthe wizards, if we're going to be like that, then, what about all those\nstudded collars and oiled muscles down at the Young Men's Pagan Association?\nTo which the heroes reply, that's a pretty good allegation from a bunch of\nwimpsoes who won't go near a woman on account, can you believe it, of their\nmystical power being sort of drained out.  Right, say the wizards, that just\nabout does it, you and your leather posing pouches.  Oh yeah, say the the\nheroes, why don't you ...\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Light Fantastic\"\n",
    "It is well known that *things* from undesirable universes are always seeking\nan entrance into this one, which is the psychic equivalent of handy for the\nbuses and closer to the shops.\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Light Fantastic\"\n",
    "\tIt seems there's this magician working one of the luxury cruise ships\nfor a few years.  He doesn't have to change his routines much as the audiences\nchange over fairly often, and he's got a good life.   The only problem is the\nship's parrot, who perches in the hall and watches him night after night, year\nafter year.  Finally, the parrot figures out how almost every trick works and\nstarts giving it away for the audience.  For example, when the magician makes\na bouquet of flowers disappear, the parrot squawks \"Behind his back!  Behind\nhis back!\"  Well, the magician is really annoyed at this, but there's not much\nhe can do about it as the parrot is a ship's mascot and very popular with the\npassengers.\n\tOne night, the ship strikes some floating debris, and sinks without\na trace.  Almost everyone aboard was lost, except for the magician and the\nparrot.  For three days and nights they just drift, with the magician clinging\nto one end of a piece of driftwood and the parrot perched on the other end.\nAs the sun rises on the morning of the fourth day, the parrot walks over to\nthe magician's end of the log.  With obvious disgust in his voice, he snaps\n\"OK, you win, I give up.  Where did you hide the ship?\"\n",

    "No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife in the shoulder blades will seriously\ncramp his style.\n",
    "Rincewind had generally been considered by his tutors to be a natural wizard\nin the same way that fish are natural mountaineers.  He probably would have\nbeen thrown out of Unseen University anyway--he couldn't remember spells and\nsmoking made him feel ill.\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Light Fantastic\"\n",
    "Somewhere, just out of sight, the unicorns are gathering.\n",
    "The default Magic Word, \"Abracadabra\", actually is a corruption of the\nHebrew phrase \"ha-Bracha dab'ra\" which means \"pronounce the blessing\".\n",

    "\tThe seven eyes of Ningauble the Wizard floated back to his hood as he\nreported to Fafhrd: \"I have seen much, yet cannot explain all.  The Gray\nMouser is exactly twenty-five feet below the deepest cellar in the palace\nof Gilpkerio Kistomerces.  Even though twenty-four parts in twenty-five of\nhim are dead, he is alive.\n\t\"Now about Lankhmar.  She's been invaded, her walls breached\neverywhere and desperate fighting is going on in the streets, by a fierce\nhost which out-numbers Lankhamar's inhabitants by fifty to one -- and\nequipped with all modern weapons.  Yet you can save the city.\"\n\t\"How?\" demanded Fafhrd.\n\tNingauble shrugged.  \"You're a hero.  You should know.\"\n\t\t-- Fritz Leiber, \"The Swords of Lankhmar\"\n",
    "\t\"Then what is magic for?\" Prince Lir demanded wildly.  \"What use is\nwizardry if it cannot save a unicorn?\"  He gripped the magician's shoulder\nhard, to keep from falling.\n\tSchmendrick did not turn his head.  With a touch of sad mockery in\nhis voice, he said, \"That's what heroes are for.\"\n...\n\t\"Yes, of course,\" he [Prince Lir] said.  \"That is exactly what heroes\nare for.  Wizards make no difference, so they say that nothing does, but\nheroes are meant to die for unicorns.\"\n\t\t-- Peter Beagle, \"The Last Unicorn\"\n",
    "There are those who claim that magic is like the tide; that it swells and\nfades over the surface of the earth, collecting in concentrated pools here\nand there, almost disappearing from other spots, leaving them parched for\nwonder.  There are also those who believe that if you stick your fingers up\nyour nose and blow, it will increase your intelligence.\n\t\t-- The Teachings of Ebenezum, Volume VII\n",
    "Unseen University had never admitted women, muttering something about\nproblems with the plumbing, but the real reason was an unspoken dread that\nif women were allowed to mess around with magic they would probably be\nembarrassingly good at it ...\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Light Fantastic\"\n",
    "Using words to describe magic is like using a screwdriver to cut roast beef.\n\t\t-- Tom Robbins\n",
    "\t\"Verily and forsooth,\" replied Goodgulf darkly.  \"In the past year\nstrange and fearful wonders I have seen.  Fields sown with barley reap\ncrabgrass and fungus, and even small gardens reject their artichoke hearts.\nThere has been a hot day in December and a blue moon.  Calendars are made with\na month of Sundays and a blue-ribbon Holstein bore alive two insurance\nsalesmen.  The earth splits and the entrails of a goat were found tied in\nsquare knots.  The face of the sun blackens and the skies have rained down\nsoggy potato chips.\"\n\t\"But what do all these things mean?\" gasped Frito.\n\t\"Beats me,\" said Goodgulf with a shrug, \"but I thought it made good\ncopy.\"\n\t\t-- Harvard Lampoon, \"Bored of the Rings\"\n",
    "Watch Rincewind.\n\nLook at him.  Scrawny, like most wizards, and clad in a dark red robe on\nwhich a few mystic sigils were embroidered in tarnished sequins. Some might\nhave taken him for a mere apprentice enchanter who had run away from his\nmaster out of defiance, boredom, fear and a lingering taste for\nheterosexuality.  Yet around his neck was a chain bearing the bronze octagon\nthat marked him as an alumnus of Unseen University, the high school of magic\nwhose time-and-space transcendent campus is never precisely Here or There.\nGraduates were usually destined for mageship at least, but Rincewind--after\nan unfortunate event--had left knowing only one spell and made a living of\nsorts around the town by capitalizing on an innate gift for languages.  He\navoided work as a rule, but had a quickness of wit that put his\nacquaintances in mind of a bright rodent.\n\t\t-- Terry Pratchett, \"The Colour of Magic\"\n",
    "What is a magician but a practising theorist?\n\t\t-- Obi-Wan Kenobi\n",

Edison's first major invention in 1877, was the\nphonograph, which could soon be found in thousands of American homes, where\nit basically sat until 1923, when the record was invented.  But Edison's\ngreatest achievement came in 1879, when he invented the electric company.\nEdison's design was a brilliant adaptation of the simple electrical circuit:\nthe electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer, then\nimmediately gets the electricity back through another wire, then (this is\nthe brilliant part) sends it right back to the customer again.\n\nThis means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of\nelectricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since very few\ncustomers take the time to examine their electricity closely. In fact the\nlast year any new electricity was generated in the United States was 1937;\nthe electric companies have been merely re-selling it ever since, which is\nwhy they have so much free time to apply for rate increases.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"What is Electricity?\"\n",

They\nhad to be helped free by the staff and, after thanking everyone,\nsheepishly left the building.\n\tA few minutes later they returned and announced their intention of\nrobbing the bank, but none of the staff believed them.  When they demanded\n5,000 pounds in cash, the head cashier laughed at them, convinced that it\nwas a practical joke.\n\tThen one of the men jumped over the counter, but fell to the floor\nclutching his ankle.

    "The Worst Prison Guards\n\tThe largest number of convicts ever to escape simultaneously from a\nmaximum security prison is 124.  This record is held by Alcoente Prison,\nnear Lisbon in Portugal.\n\tDuring the weeks leading up to the escape in July 1978 the prison\nwarders had noticed that attendances had fallen at film shows which\nincluded \"The Great Escape\", and also that 220 knives and a huge quantity\nof electric cable had disappeared.  A guard explained, \"Yes, we were\nplanning to look for them, but never got around to it.\"  The warders had\nnot, however, noticed the gaping holes in the wall because they were\n\"covered with posters\".  Nor did they detect any of the spades, chisels,\nwater hoses and electric drills amassed by the inmates in large quantities.\nThe night before the breakout one guard had noticed that of the 36\nprisoners in his block only 13 were present.  He said this was \"normal\"\nbecause inmates sometimes missed roll-call or hid, but usually came back\nthe next morning.\n\t\"We only found out about the escape at 6:30 the next morning when\none of the prisoners told us,\" a warder said later.

    "As long as there are entrenched social and political distinctions\nbetween sexes, races or classes, there will be forms of science whose\nmain function is to rationalize and legitimize these distinctions.\n\t\t-- Elizabeth Fee\n",
    "Cautious, careful people always casting about to preserve their\nreputation or social standards never can bring about reform.  Those\nwho are totally in earnest are willing to be anything or nothing in\nthe world's estimation, and publicly and privately, in season and\nout, avow their sympathies with despised ideas and their advocates,\nand bear the consequences.\n\t\t-- Susan B. Anthony (1873)\n",
    "\"Even if you want no state, or a minimal state, then you still have to\nargue it point by point.  Especially since most minimalists want to\nkeep exactly the economic and police system that keeps them\nprivileged.  That's libertarians for you -- anarchists who want police\nprotection from their slaves!\"\n\t\t-- Coyote, in Kim Stanley Robinson's \"Green Mars\"\n",
    "And they mainly want to teach them not to question, not to imagine,\nbut to be obedient and behave well so that they can hold them forever as\nchildren to their bosom as the second millennium lurches toward its\npanicky close.\n\t\t-- Jerome Stern\n",
    "I've no regrets. I was sincere in everything I said.\n\t\t-- Former Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, \n\t\t   annoucing his new book\n",
    "The first sign of corruption in a society that is still alive is that\nthe end justifies the means.\n\t\t-- Georges Bernanos (1888-1948), French novelist,\n                   political writer. \"Why Freedom?\" The last essays of\n\t\t   George Bernanos (1955)\n",
